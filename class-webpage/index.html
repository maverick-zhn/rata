    <p>The class provides insights about: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Multi-modal data fusion, knowledge graphs, modeling context and situation awareness, user profiling, and matching interests with streaming data ( sensors, text, tweets, video, news articles, emails, phone calls), pattern recognition, data mining, intelligent query processing. Machine learning models to connect user's needs with data based on situation and context awareness.
  </li>

  <li>
    Privacy-enabling frameworks for situational-aware systems. Representing networks and knowledge graphs using graph databases, graph analytics for enhancing search.
  </li>

  <li>
  Machine learning in data cleaning, video data understanding, and data mining and identifying objects and events. Modeling user queries to build knowledge graphs to target data to users. 
  AutoML and self-supervised learning: Deep learning to accelerate the labeling of data and carefully tune hyper-parameters. Learn automatically and learn on unlabeled data to make machine learning accurate and efficient. Labeling and learning with incomplete or limited data.
  </li>

  <li>
  Joint Modeling (Language Modeling, Multi-modal modeling, User Modeling), Open Information Extraction, Attribute Extraction, Relation Extraction, Similarity Learning, Graph Similarity, Pedestrian Attribute and Action Recognition, Intent Classification. The use of tweets as the people's information to visualize topic modeling, study subjectivity, and model the human emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sharing information (e.g., personal opinions, some facts, news, status, etc.) on social media platforms, which can be helpful to understand the various public behavior such as emotions, sentiments, and mobility during the ongoing pandemic and police encounters. Deep Learning approach for tweet classification for disaster management. Hierarchical deep learning model using text embedding via Crisis and GloVe, bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM), attention, and convolution layers.
  </li>

  <li>
  Attacks on ML models, training data, and streaming data. Preserving privacy and security by monitoring attacks, mitigating attacks, dealing with changing behavior of adversary, collaborative attacks, predicting attacks, and intent. Deep learning-based Programming Language Processing for Detecting Evasive Cyber-attacks, Trusted Classification under Poisoning attacks using Semantic Factors. Bias and Fairness in ML, what fairness means, causes that introduce unfairness in ML, Data-driven methods that unintentionally encode existing human biases and introduce new ones.
  </li>

  <li>
  Defensive methods to protect Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). 
  </li>

  <li>
  The success DNNs in image-related applications is threatened by their vulnerability to adversarial settings, including trojan and adversarial sample attacks. A detailed explanation of these types of attacks and countering methods are covered.
  </li>

  <li>
  Insider threats are considered one of the most serious and difficult problems to solve, given the privileges and information available to insiders to launch different types of attacks. Current security systems can record and analyze sequences from a deluge of log data, potentially becoming a tool to detect insider threats. The issue is that insiders mix the sequence of attack steps with valid actions, reducing the capacity of security systems to discern long sequences and programmatically detect the executed attacks. M Deep learning-based methods are introduced, which overcome the existing limitations and protect against these types of attacks.
  </li>

  <li>
  Monitoring and learning of attacks on autonomous systems and cyber attribution. 
  </li>

  <li>
  Enhancing Cognitive Autonomy through Deep learning. Autonomous systems, explanation of ML, and actions of autonomous activity with humans in the loop.
  </li>

  <li>
  Attacks on space system protocols that use moving target defense and utilizing ML to identify intent and devising methods to mitigate.
  </li>

  <li>
  Graph machine learning, graph structure to understand the social network and extract useful information to analyze social relationships. 
  </li>

  <li>
  Building recommendation systems. Deep learning in trading: Deep learning to track the market and make trading decisions.
  </li>

  <li>
  Privacy-preserving predictive modeling in edge networks, privacy issues in ML used in contact tracing.
  </li>

</ul>

    <p> <b>Class Format</b>
    <ul>
    <li><p>This is a seminar course. Each class will consist of presentations and discussions. Students will be required to do a class project for the course. A significant portion of the grade will be based on projects and class/research contributions, including paper presentations, contributions to paper reviews, and paper discussions. 
    </p></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
<p>
  <b>Assignments</b>
      <ul>
       
      </ul>            
</p>

<p>

  <b>Project</b>
    <ul>
      <li>A research class project: Each of you will work on a research project. Group projects are encouraged. The project will be broken down into three assignments: (1) initial research proposal, (2) intermediate report, (3) final report, and presentation.
      </li>
    	<li> Feel free to discuss your ideas with the instructor and propose your own project. The project should have a research component. Project ideas will be outlined in class, but you are responsible for proposing your project. Some background reading is associated with each project.
    The project proposal (due date October 5) should contain the following information:
    <ul>
      <li>Topic to be addressed and problem definition.
      <li>State of the art (prior work, what was done and what needs to be done.)
      <li>The proposed technique to be advanced, developed and implemented/evaluated.
      <li>How does your work advance the solution to the problem?.
      <li>Algorithm proposed, Experiments and Data collected, Conclusions/Guidelines.
    </ul>
        Project proposals should be a couple of pages at most. A project status report is due on November 2nd. 
    		The status report should include a description of progress to date and what is expected to be accomplished by 
    		the final project presentation day.
      </li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
   <b>Exams</b>
   <ul>

     <li>We can have a final examination as needed (TBA).</li>

   </ul>

</p>
<p><b>Misc</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Class time may be adjusted to accomodate external talks releated to the class.</li>
